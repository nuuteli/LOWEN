check the average stats of lowen so you can decide whether he needs stat boosters (joshua included now as well!!)
growth calculation is [level * growth] (i think it's the most reliable way to count it, only the very first level up is unreliable due to zero gains)
stat caps and growth rates included so you don't have to check them elsewhere!!
